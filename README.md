## API
### sections
`'artist', 'game', 'tv', 'movies', 'book'`

### .to(entry, callback)
Find similar entries to the one provided.

`entry` is expected to be either a string or an object. If `entry` is a string,
it's presumed to be a *similarkind* identifier.
Otherwise, `entry` is expected to have either an `id` property, or a `title`
property with optional additional specifiers `year` and `section`. See above
for section options.

`callback` returns an array of similar entries. Each entry is an object
containing the following properties: `id`, `title` and `year`.

### .getGenres(entry, callback)
Get a list of genres for an entry.

`entry` is the same object as described in *to*.

`callback` returns a list of genres for the entry (an array of strings).

### .withGenres(genres, callback)
Find entries with matching genres.

`genres` is expected to be either a string, or an array of up to three strings.

`callback` will return a list of entries in the same format as `.to`.
